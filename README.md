This repo contains three things:

- Custom-made visualization tools appropriate for Ramsey theory. E.g., highlighting monochromatic copies of subgraphs within large networks.
- Efficient algorithms to compute monochromatic copies of sought subgraphs within large networks. E.g. `FindMonochTriangle(H)` returns a list of three edges of the same color in constant time.
- Applications of the above functions to other areas: solving colored linear equations, finding long monotone sublists, etc.
